### info on how its working
The network generates the bounding boxes first, and then filters them to pick the most accurate ones, and then finally applies the mask branch only on the detected boxes. This arrangement actually makes the network faster because it allows it to run the mask branch (which is a heavy branch) only on the boxes that have already been filtered.

### maskrcnn output 
results = model.detect([image1,image2], verbose=0)
r1 = results[0] #take results of the image1
r2 = results[1] #take results of the image2
r1['rois'] #bbox: x1,y1,x2,y2
r1['masks'] #binary masks
